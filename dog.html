                <p>
                    Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have
                    the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t
                    know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we
                    understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on
                    past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs
                    are the perfect example of this.

                    The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from
                    extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the
                    first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of
                    agriculture.
